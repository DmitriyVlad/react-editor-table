### Development Setup

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DmitriyVlad/react-editor-table.git
cd react-editor-table/
packagemanager install
npm run start
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

1. Clone this repository and go to the project folder

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DmitriyVlad/react-editor-table.git
    cd react-editor-table/
    ```

2. Install the required packages/modules:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. Run dev environment:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    You can now open the app on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).
